LegoMyApp is my contribution to a collections themed application produced by Prosper IT Consulting. LegoMyApp was designed to store and catalog collections of Lego sets and Lego mini figures, each having its own database. Users could upload images using the ImageField function, add a description in the text field, and sort collections using keyword id's. I then added functionality to allow users to edit or delete selections. The app was expanded further by adding an API using JSON, so users could check the whether in their location to see about playing Legos outside. The whether API presented a unique challenge for a couple of reasons. The first being the location required latitude and longitude, which then needed to be translated into an actual city. The second peculiarity was that the temperature was displayed in degrees Kelvin. I added an equation to convert Kelvin to degrees Fahrenheit.
